# Self-hosted Cloudflare relay

The [Cloudflare relay](cloudflare/README.md) connects compatible OmniTerm clients
and agents over WebSockets, with optional native WebRTC signaling through a
separately deployed RTC ingress. Deploy it to your own Cloudflare account and
create your own access token; no private source or maintainer credentials are
needed.

The kit contains a Worker, its routing code, a deployment configuration, and tests.
It does not include the desktop/mobile apps, an SSH server, or a STUN/TURN server.

For browser live-share over MoQ, deploy the first-party HTTP/3 provider from
[moq](moq/README.md). It owns active WebTransport sessions and confirms cutoff
before acknowledging viewer removal. The live-share origin needs the provider's
HTTPS control origin and independent control token, and the web deployment must
set `moq_origin` to the same HTTPS origin.

Use Node.js 24.21.0 or newer. The MoQ endpoint also needs direct UDP/443 access;
do not assume an HTTP-only reverse proxy supports WebTransport.
